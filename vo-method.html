	<h1>Vo Method</h1>
	<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>External input must be converted to binary choices in order to be accurately processed by machines. </li>
	<li>Not all decisions are created equal. Some decisions require strict rules while others can be made up.
 </li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Before You get started</h3>
	<p>The Vo Method uses variables, lists, if/else statements and functions. In that way a person familiar with computer code should feel at home with the Vo Method.
	However at its core the Vo Method is about rethinking how to break down / build up data, how to organize/ structure if/ else statements and how to decide the order in which the task is completed.
	In this way the Vo Method can feel like learning a new language and put your critical thinking skills to the test. 
  </p>
	
	<p>The python program provided on Github is intended for educational and research purposes. If you wish to incorporate the Vo Method into your own projects
	feel free to do so. However it is recommended that you build it from scratch to better fit your own requirements.     </p>
	<h3>Setup</h3>
	
		<ul>
			<li>Download the python file from github. </li>
			<li>Make sure you have python installed. </li>
			<li>Open the python file and change the save_path variable to where you would like the output to be saved. </li>
		<li>Create a folder named text in the same location as the save path. </li>
		</ul>
		<h3>User Interface</h3>
		<p>There are two text boxes name and details. Name is the name of the project and details is where you put details on how you want the task completed.
		There are four buttons Control HTML, Vo Method HTML and two more for you to plugin your own code and do your own research.</p>
		<h3>The Control</h3>
		<p>In the control we are going to make decisions directly from the external input.</p>
		<h4>Step 1: Collect Input</h4>
		<h4>Step 2: Decide Variables</h4>
		<h4>Step 3: Create Output</h4>
		<h3>The Vo Method</h3>
		<h4>Step 1: Collect Input</h4>
		<h4>Step 2: Store Input</h4>
		<h4>Step 3: Find Keywords</h4>
		<h4>Step 4: Set variables to NULL</h4>
		<h4>Step 5:Pick the order in which the task should be completed</h4>
		<h4>Step 6: Create Output</h4>
